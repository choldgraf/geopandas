        "\nData Structures\n===============\n\nGeoPandas implements two main data structures, a ``GeoSeries`` and a\n``GeoDataFrame``.  These are subclasses of pandas ``Series`` and\n``DataFrame``, respectively.\n\n.. currentmodule:: geopandas\n\nGeoSeries\n---------\n\nA ``GeoSeries`` is essentially a vector where each entry in the vector\nis a set of shapes corresponding to one observation. An entry may consist\nof only one shape (like a single polygon) or multiple shapes that are\nmeant to be thought of as one observation (like the many polygons that\nmake up the State of Hawaii or a country like Indonesia).\n\n*geopandas* has three basic classes of geometric objects (which are actually\n*shapely* objects):\n\n* Points / Multi-Points\n* Lines / Multi-Lines\n* Polygons / Multi-Polygons\n\nNote that all entries in  a ``GeoSeries`` need not be of the same geometric\ntype, although certain export operations will fail if this is not the case.\n\nOverview of Attributes and Methods\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe ``GeoSeries`` class implements nearly all of the attributes and\nmethods of Shapely objects.  When applied to a ``GeoSeries``, they\nwill apply elementwise to all geometries in the series.  Binary\noperations can be applied between two ``GeoSeries``, in which case the\noperation is carried out elementwise.  The two series will be aligned\nby matching indices.  Binary operations can also be applied to a\nsingle geometry, in which case the operation is carried out for each\nelement of the series with that geometry.  In either case, a\n``Series`` or a ``GeoSeries`` will be returned, as appropriate.\n\nA short summary of a few attributes and methods for GeoSeries is\npresented here, and a full list can be found in the :doc:`all attributes and\nmethods page <reference>`.\nThere is also a family of methods for creating new shapes by expanding\nexisting shapes or applying set-theoretic operations like \"union\" described\nin :doc:`geometric manipulations <geometric_manipulations>`.\n\nAttributes\n^^^^^^^^^^\n* ``area``: shape area (units of projection -- see :doc:`projections\n  <projections>`)\n* ``bounds``: tuple of max and min coordinates on each axis for each shape\n* ``total_bounds``: tuple of max and min coordinates on each axis for entire\n  GeoSeries\n* ``geom_type``: type of geometry.\n* ``is_valid``: tests if coordinates make a shape that is reasonable geometric\n  shape (`according to this <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa>`_).\n\nBasic Methods\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n* ``distance(other)``: returns ``Series`` with minimum distance from each entry\n  to ``other``\n* ``centroid``: returns ``GeoSeries`` of centroids\n* ``representative_point()``:  returns ``GeoSeries`` of points that are\n  guaranteed to be within each geometry. It does **NOT** return centroids.\n* ``to_crs()``: change coordinate reference system. See :doc:`projections\n  <projections>`\n* ``plot()``: plot ``GeoSeries``. See :doc:`mapping <mapping>`.\n\nRelationship Tests\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n* ``geom_almost_equals(other)``: is shape almost the same as ``other``\n  (good when floating point precision issues make shapes slightly different)\n* ``contains(other)``: is shape contained within ``other``\n* ``intersects(other)``: does shape intersect ``other``\n\n\nGeoDataFrame\n------------\n\nA ``GeoDataFrame`` is a tabular data structure that contains a ``GeoSeries``.\n\nThe most important property of a ``GeoDataFrame`` is that it always has one\n``GeoSeries`` column that holds a special status. This ``GeoSeries`` is\nreferred to as the ``GeoDataFrame``'s \"geometry\". When a spatial method\nis applied to a ``GeoDataFrame`` (or a spatial attribute like ``area``\nis called), this commands will always act on the \"geometry\" column.\n\nThe \"geometry\" column -- no matter its name -- can be accessed through\nthe ``geometry`` attribute (``gdf.geometry``), and the name of the\n``geometry`` column can be found by typing ``gdf.geometry.name``.\n\nA ``GeoDataFrame`` may also contain other columns with geometrical\n(shapely) objects, but only one column can be the active geometry\nat a time. To change which column is the active geometry column,\nuse the ``set_geometry`` method.\n\nAn example using the ``worlds`` GeoDataFrame:\n\n\n"
